# java-playground

This is a repository for the Galvanize java, pilot course.
This will be a chronicle of my progress as I navigate through the program.
While I already have some basic knowledge of Java I hope to build on that knowledge base and help future students by going through each exercise in order to find issues that will then be reported to the staff.
