# java-playground

This is a repository for the Galvanize java, pilot course.
This will be a chronicle of my progress as I navigate trhough the program.
While I already have some basic knowledge of Java I hope to build on that knowledge and help future students by going through
each exercise in order to find issues that I will then report to the staff.
